This is a semester long group project with 3 other students in Second Year in University Of Southampton Software Engineering.
It is a java based application that recalculates an airport runway based on CAA regulations of UK airports.

It is built in Eclipse Luna using JDK 8, SimpleXML and javax.mail. The project was done in an agile environment with 3 development increments. This is the direct eclipse project directory including the classpath.

The main features are - 

1. Support for multiple airports each with multiple airfields each of which can in turn be used in both directions.
2. Runways can be viewed top-down and side on with all standard runway parameters being shown.
3. Views can be zoomed in and out, panned, saved as PNG or JPEG, rotated to match physical direction to north.
4. Views have movable scales for potential measuring.
5. Export and import airports and obstacles as xml files.
6. Receive notifications for varius updates to the application.
7. Receive email notifications (optional for user) for the same updates.
8. View airport data next to the views.
9. Have a breakdown of recalculation of a runway because of an obstacle
10. Print out any notification (including breakdown of calculations) to hard copy
11. Extensive help feature that has quickstart, FAQ and contact of developers.

The development heavily focused on the usability of the application and is thus very user friendly.
